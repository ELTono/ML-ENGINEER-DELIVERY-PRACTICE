# ML-ENGINEER-DELIVERY-PRACTICE
## Motivation
As a part of my journey in becoming a better full stack data scientist , I have decided to improve my ml engineering skills to improve the way I productionalize models. The skills I am aiming to improve are things like docker testing and best practices, best ways to write code to encansulape training of models, best practices to user logger inside ml-pipelines, understand better the flow of git and git best practices. Also I want to collect best practices to structure code for data, serving and client pipelines, this would include when to use clases for training of models and general best engineering standards for ML. 

## Deliberate Practice
I consider that the best way to hone my skills is by implementing fixes to my work code implementing best standards. Also to read best practices for docker and playing with how to test locally before testing in a CI/CD pipeline. 

* __Identify the Top Performers__: For the docker and CI/CD part Volo is the best guy to go to for opinions and recommendations.

* __Targeted practice__: Read docker best practices for ML, read Git book and play in general with testing docker. Also, it is crucial to review my code from work and think how to improve it following better standards like more loggings, classes and ml structures.

* __Immediate Feedbacks__: I think the immediate feedbacks would be to be able to test with no problems and docker container, understand how the commits tags in git goes.

## Performance goals
* __[Immediate]__ Learn about the best ways to implement ML engineering.
* __[Short term]__ First, to learn the best practices of docker and git flow. Second, . Finally, improve my production level code by mastering the uses of classes and practice by writing my own sklearn estimators to build pipelines.

## Project Goals
* __Outcome__ : I want to improve my production level code skills. This means all my code would be as pythonic as possible (like following PEP 8, using try and assert, correct docstrings and standards) and with a good use of OOP to create classes to handle any data pipeline from cleaning to modeling.

* __Curriculum__: Everything related to ML-Engineering practices I can find.

* __Timeframe__: I am aiming for a 3 month time to improve all my general ML engineering skills including docker, git and ml code for training.
